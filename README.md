# Medical-diagnostic-system

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The project is a medical diagnostic system for children suffering from particular symptoms.
The symptoms of the child is taken as input and the program returns the probable cause of the disease with a full diagnostic report. The diagnostic report contains the disease that most probably caused the given symptoms for the child. Also, a description about the disease is also provided so that it is easy for the person reading the report, especially the childâ€™s parents, to know about the disease.
It also contains instructions about who should be notified and suggests remedy for the disease caused.
The system was made using s(ASP).
